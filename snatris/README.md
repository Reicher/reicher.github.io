SNATRIS!

A mix between tetris and snake.

Todo short term:
* More audio - ~~Game over~~, ~~confirm~~, background
* Highscore screen - ~~Shows current score and best personal score ever etc~~.
* ~~Move the gameborder away from screen edge~~.

Todo sometime maybe:
* Mute-button on main menu.
* Change screen size, make it dynamic? is it even possible?
* More game modes! Static?
* More pieces!
* Planets to "eat"?!
* new background?
* ~~Cool logo~~
* Zardoz cameo?!
